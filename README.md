# CV Builder

This is a CV builder built using JavaScript. The cv builder uses
localStorage to store the user information then get the data from a the localStorage
to create a CV based on the template created. Then user can download the CV as a PDF file.

To create the PDF we used a package called *html2pdf* to covert our HTML file to a PDF format for the user to use.
